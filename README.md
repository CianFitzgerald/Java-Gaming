# Java-Gaming
Java implementation of a simple games system with points and a leaderboard

In order to implement the project a total of 4 classes were used, these include:

• Console – The main method is contained within this class which provides the user with a games console with various menus, games and a player leader board on termination.

• Player – This is the superclass which stores information associated with each player who
plays.

• VIPPlayer – This is a subclass of the player class that inherits the majority of the
superclass methods, except that it deals with points additions and deductions differently
for VIP players.

• LimitedPlayer – Similarly, this is a subclass of Player that deals with point additions and
deductions differently for limited players.
